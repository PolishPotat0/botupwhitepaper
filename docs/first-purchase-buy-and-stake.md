# First Purchase Buy and Stake

This is specific for people who purchase for the first time AFTER staking has gone live.

## Step 1

Navigate to the home page at [Memekombat.io](https://memekombat.io)

- Connect your wallet and select how much $MK tokens you wish to purchase.
- In the presale buy box, there will be a button that says "Buy and Stake". This is for those who wish to buy and stake their $MK during presale, which will allow you to immediately begin earning APY during the presale.

## Step 2

- Once you click Buy and Stake your wallet will display a transaction that you must approve, once that is complete your transaction of buying and staking $MK will be complete. You can track your staked tokens on the Meme Kombat staking page [here](https://memekombat.io/staking).
- If you wish to buy $MK, but not stake your tokens you can click the link below that says "Buy Without Staking."

## Special Note

For those who purchase on BSC, this process requires a manual update of your purchase to allow claiming on Eth network. This manual process will occur frequently, but is not immediate. It will be done in batches each day during presale.
