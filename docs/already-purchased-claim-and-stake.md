# Already Purchased? Claim & Stake

Specific to those who have already purchased during presale

## Follow these instructions to stake your $MK tokens and earn dynamic staking rewards during presale

###Step 1

Navigate to the home page at [Memekombat.io](https://memekombat.io/)

- Once on the home page, in the presale buy box, there will be a link that says "Already purchased? Click here to claim". Click this link.

- This will change the form to your purchased $MK tokens display. The token amount will include both the $MK tokens you have purchased AND any $MK tokens you have accrued through staking since purchase. 

## If you have purchased on multiple wallets, you will need to complete this process for each wallet. 

###Step 2

## Now it's time to claim and stake

- Now it's time to claim and stake. Click the button that says "Claim and Stake". This will initiate a transaction in your wallet. This requires paying a network fee (dependent on GWEI or network congestion).
- Once you approve the transaction and pay the gas fee, you will be able to track the transaction via the Meme Kombat staking page, located here [https://memekombat.io/staking](https://memekombat.io/staking)
